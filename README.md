# Hey there! 👋

I'm Khalid, a Computer Engineering student based in Saudi Arabia.

I like building intelligent systems and turning ideas into real projects.  
Most of my work sits at the intersection of AI/ML, embedded systems, and digital design.

If something sounds challenging, I’ll probably try to build it.



### Tech I work with
Python • C/C++ • MATLAB • SQL  
Machine Learning • Data Structures  
Raspberry Pi • Embedded Systems  
CMOS & Digital Logic Design  



### Currently
- Diving deeper into AI/ML
- Building practical engineering projects
